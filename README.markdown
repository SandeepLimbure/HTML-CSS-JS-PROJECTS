The repository currently includes the following projects:
1. **Alarm Clock**: A digital clock with alarm-setting functionality.
2. **Cheatsheet Template**: A clean, organized template for quick-reference guides.
3. **Moving Lamborghini**: An animated car driving across the screen.
4. **Windows 11**: A web-based replica of the Windows 11 interface.
5. **Action Game**: A simple browser-based action game.
6. **Calculator**: A fully functional calculator for basic arithmetic.
7. **Spotify Clone**: A music player interface inspired by Spotify.

## Features
- **Interactive UI**: Each project offers engaging user interactions, from button clicks to animations.
- **Responsive Design**: Projects are styled with CSS to look great on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Installation
To run any project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- A code editor (e.g., VS Code) for exploring or modifying the code.
- (Optional) A local server like Live Server (VS Code extension) for better testing.

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/web-dev-projects.git
   cd web-dev-projects
   ```

2. **Navigate to a Project**:
   Each project is stored in its own folder (e.g., `alarm-clock`, `spotify-clone`). Navigate to the desired project folder:
   ```bash
   cd alarm-clock
   ```

3. **Open the Project**:
   Open the `index.html` file in a browser:
   - Double-click `index.html` to view it directly.
   - Or, use a local server for dynamic testing:
     ```bash
     npx live-server
     ```
     This will open the project in your default browser.

4. **Explore or Modify**:
   Use a code editor to view or edit the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in each project folder.

## Usage
1. **Browse Projects**:
   - Each project folder contains an `index.html` file as the entry point.
   - Open `index.html` in a browser to interact with the project.

2. **Interact with Features**:
   - **Alarm Clock**: Set an alarm time and wait for the notification.
   - **Cheatsheet Template**: Toggle sections or customize the content.
   - **Moving Lamborghini**: Click buttons to start/stop the car animation.
   - **Windows 11**: Click the start menu or drag windows around.
   - **Action Game**: Use keyboard controls (e.g., arrow keys) to play.
   - **Calculator**: Click buttons to perform calculations.
   - **Spotify Clone**: Play songs, skip tracks, or adjust the progress bar.

3. **Learn and Experiment**:
   - Check the code comments for explanations of how each project works.
   - Modify the CSS or JavaScript to customize the projects or add new features.
